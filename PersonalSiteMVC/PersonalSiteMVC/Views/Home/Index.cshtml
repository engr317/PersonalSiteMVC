                    For 20 years I was able to persue one of my dreams to become a U.S. Army Soldier.  Teaching me communucation, leadership, and direction along the way.  Now, it is time for me to pick up my second passion.  One that will take me well beyond where I think I may go.  One that will put me in touch with the latest technology with the help of some of the best teams, Web Development.
